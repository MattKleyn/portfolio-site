Overview
This portfolio project was built to be a platform where I can show my work as a junior web designer and dev. It acts as a central hub where a user can view all my completed and in progress projects, read up on the case studies and also link to my LinkedIn or Github accounts. Further this portfolio acts as a place where a user can gain insight as to who I am as a person and a professional. As such, this repository is for viewing and code review only, and not meant to be cloned, forked, or reused without explicit permission from myself.

Features & Design Philosophy
It is a static multi-page web porfolio built with only HTML and CSS. In the future I will overhaul it to make use of EJS templating for easier use and alterations of partials and dynamic rendering. I may also create a SQL database, and make use of React components later on.
In terms of aesthetics and UX/UI, I opted for a simple minimalist layout and animation style. I wanted to minimise distractions and random 'fluff', however due to this I need to ensure I have a strong overall design and layout sothat it doesnt feel flat and unfinished. A carefull balance to be struck.
