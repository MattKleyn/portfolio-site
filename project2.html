                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The initial concept was a site for me to write and learn more about amphibians, however, it has morphed into a site where I intend to document my progress as a designer and developer. Further I wish to develop and improve it beyond just a simple CRUD app and evolve it into a multi-user platform for people to write about their learnings in tech, whether a user is starting from scratch and just wants to write about how excited they are to learn their first language to more seasoned devs discussing how to design systems that scale well while keeping costs to a minimum. A collection of information from all skill levels, information by the people, for the people.</p>
                <p>Project Goal: The main goal is to build a dynamically rendered CRUD blog platform using what I have learnt in my fullstack web developer course. Secondary goals include adding multi-user utilization, data persistence, and machine learning for personalized recommendations.</p>
                <p>Approach: Iterative 4-phase build with a refactor-first mindset to prioritize experimentation, learning, scalability and maintainability.</p>
                <p>For more info, have a look at the <a href="">README.md</a></p>

                <h2>Main body: From Vision to Execution</h2>
                <h3>Software Architecture</h3>
                <p>Monolithic Acrchetecture: While not intentional, phase 1 rollout resembles a monolithic archetecture, by having all the Javascript code in a single file which is also all compiled at runtime. Phase 2 will move towards a modular monolithic archetecture will a clear separation of concerns and logic split among multiple files. This modularity will make testing more centralized and ensure each module can scale independently of each other. A potential switch to a hybrid modular-monolith and microservice archetecture may be in the offing for future expansion, specifically with the eventual addition of machine learning functionalities.</p>
                <p>Multi-phased rollout: To prioritize learning, the project is split into distinct phases to enable me to meet the original project requirements while allowing me to reflect and expand further down the line. The phases are further explained under the deployment strategy.</p>
                <p>Modularity: Codebase structured into reusable utilities, middleware, and route handlers to improve readability and for ease of testing.</p>
                <p>Rendering Strategy: REST routes with dynamic EJS rendering based on content type and length.</p>
                <p>REST routing: While the HTTP requests may not be entirely RESTful, i.e. not conforming strictly to REST constraints, the current rollout does include REST routes. During phase 2 and phase 3 the routes will be cleaned up to confom more cleanly to RESTful concepts.</p>
                <p>Data Flow: The initial brief was to not have data persistence however; I opted for an unstructured JSON-based persistence for Phase 1 where the data schema is flexible enough to evolve as the requirements see fit during development. Phase 3 will include the creation and migration from JSON to a SQL database to better support search paramaters and data relationships.</p>
                <p>Delete Logic: With specific UX considerations, I implemented a confirmation screen/modal, timed/delay undo, and archive states to prevent accidental loss and support recovery of all article object data.</p>
            </section>    

            <section class="dark-on-light-alternate">    
                <h3>Systems Design</h3>
                <p>Routing Strategy: Dynamic routes (/posts/:id) for scalability and semantic clarity. This also enables better URL clarity for UX considerations (sharing, bookmarking). This also aids in dynamic layout rendering down the line based on specific article lengths.</p>
                <p>Async Handling: Initial use of nested callbacks for phase 1 with a refactor plan including promises and async/await to prevent race conditions and potential wiped databases which already occurred during development.</p>
                <p>Schema Evolution: Designed to be updated as object data complexity increases to support comments, tags, user profiles, and archived states.</p>
                <p>Error Handling: To ensure consistent and maintainable error responses, I implemented centralized error handling using shared middleware and utility functions. This separation of concerns improves developer readability and guarantees that user-facing error messages are uniform across the application. Future plans include fallback UI components for smoother user experience during failed requests or invalid input.</p>

                <h3>Tech stack</h3>
                <p>The tech stack is split into two parts, current implementation and future expansion. The current implementation are aspects that I have learned or am currently learning in my online coursework to satisfy the assignment brief. The future expansion deals with tech that I will be learning in the near future either through coursework or self-directed learning, this also relates to the phased rollout to create features in my current capacity and plan future features with the relevant technologies.</p>

                <h2>Role of AI in the Project</h2>
                <p>With the prevalence of AI and the benefits it can bring to a project, I opted to utilize it on the blog project with a few caveats:</p>
                <p>Mentorship and not developing a reliance on AI: giving explicit instructions to not code for me and to 'go Socrates mode', enabled me to use AI as a collaborator and mentor instead of a code monkey. I would still steer the ship, write the code, decide which methods to use, make architectural and system decisions. This approach allowed me to simulate mentorship and architectural dialogue, rather than outsourcing problem-solving</p>
                <p>Learning scaffold: Using AI as a mentor and collaborator I could efficiently explore various methodologies, terminologies and concepts to better guide my knowledgebase and decision making process. By restricting the AI output and scope clarification, I could still build real world problem solving.</p>
                <p>Documentation coach: a critical aspect for collaboration and working in teams, AI gave guidance to best practices to document the project through case studies, README, and reminders of things to explore/learn.</p>
                <p>Debugging partner: helped to trace logic errors and plan refactoring strategies.</p>
            </section>

                <div class="section_num"><p>4</p></div>
                <h2>Reflection & What to Improve</h2>
                <h3>What I would do differently</h3>
                <p>Start with async/await from the beginning to avoid nested callback complexity</p>
                <p>Introduce modularization earlier to reduce refactor overhead</p>
                <p>Start writing tests and error handling from the get go to prevent and catch errors earlier on and to reduce refactor overhead. Additionally where potentially destructive processes involved, test and error handling should be prioritized.</p>
                <p>Prioritize accessibility tooling sooner (e.g., axe-core audits)</p>
                <p>More in-depth layout designs, UX/UI considerations and a proper design brief would have reduced the time to complete the styling.</p>
            </section>    

            <section class="dark-on-light-alternate">     
                <h3>Learning vs Scalability</h3>
                <p>JSON persistence was chosen for schema experimentation, not long-term scalability due to current knowledge gaps. At the same time provided a natural way to experiment with array and object manipulation.</p>
                <p>Some layout decisions favoured expressiveness over convention to support creative UX but the limitations w.r.t. dynamic rendering were unknown. The layout had to support dynamic rendering over static rendering.</p>
                <p>Robust testing and error handling critical to ensure a multi-user system does not shut down and to ensure there is no user-related errors due to missing input fields or malformed data.</p>
            </section>    

            <section class="light-on-dark-alternate">     
                <h3>Philosophy</h3>
                <p>Code as a pencil drawing: Every decision is iterative and revisable</p>
                <p>Quality over quantity: One deeply intentional project reveals more than a dozen rushed ones</p>
                <p>AI as collaborator: Not just a tool, but a thinking partner shaping both code and mindset</p>
                <p>Project based learning: watching and following tutorials only goes so far. Problem solving skills can not be taught but need to be cultivated, learnt - the hard way.</p>
