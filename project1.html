                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>A static multipage website built from the ground up to showcase my abilities to design and develop various software solutions. This site also serves as a way to market my skillset to potential employers and collaborators. It will always be a work in progress as the site and contents will be updated as my skills progress and as projects are started and completed.</p>

                <h2>Problems and solutions</h2>
                <p>All designers and developers need a way to showcase their skills and experience to outside parties, whether it is for employment oppertunities, collaborave oppertunities or even just for personal shits and giggles. This usually comes in the form of a portfolio, however a portfolio is more than just a list of technical skills, completed coursework, and work experience. A portfolio should also display a sense of self (otherwise we may as well just look at a single page resume), and it would ultimately be the first impression to the viewer of who I am, as a designer, a developer, and as a person. </p>
                <p>As a self-taught/ online bootcamp graduate, I dont have an IT degree and I dont have industry experience, so my portfolio is the first vehicle to get my foot in the door at a company. I would need to demonstrate the following skills in the portfolio:</p>
                <ul class="features-list">
                    <li>The ability to gather inspiration and create a conceptual design that is detailed and clear enough to hand over to a developer.</li>
                    <li>A design that is functional, easy and intuitive to use, and aesthetically pleasing while not being cumbersome or unnecessarily cluttered.</li>
                    <li>A good understanding of semantic HTML and being able to add CSS styling according to the design. Additionally having an effective class naming and styling system to make it easier to make changes down the line.</li>
                    <li>Having the understanding and ability to make the site responsive for any viewport size.</li>
                    <li>While it may be overkill for a portfolio website, being able to demonstrate an understanding of Accessibility requirements is a plus.</li>
                    <li>Makes use of version control, I have been using Git to store my code in main branch on my Github profile so when I experiment in the future or mess something up then I can access previous working versions of the site.</li>
                    <li>Here's a more abstract one, foreward thinking. While the site may only have a few small projects at the moment, I have a list of things I want to try and showcase, ranging from dynamic Webflow sites, to more complex machine learning scripts in Python. So at some point I want to develop a CMS or some backend Javascript and EJS to more effectively store, retrieve and display the multitudes of projects in a singluar template. This will also help with the maintainability of the site.</li>
